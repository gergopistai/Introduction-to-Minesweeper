                <h2>Basics of Minesweeper</h2>
                <h3>How the game works</h3>
                <p>A game of minesweeper is played on a grid of cells. Every cell can be opened, but the point of the game is to find (and flag) all the cells that are mines. If you click a mine you will lose the game. The game can be only be won if every non-mine cell is opened. You can open cells by left clicking on them.</p>
                <p>Most opened cells will have a number on them. This number represents how many mines are adjacent to that given cell (adjacency here includes diagonal cells as well).</p>

                <p>There are usually two game modes: <i>Normal</i> and <i>No Guess</i> (NG for short).</p>
                <p>Normal mode is entirely randomly generated, so there are usually a log of guessing whether a certain cell is a mine.</p>
                <p>NG games however can be won without guessing, by simply using pattern recognition. There will be some easier patterns in the <a href="#patterns" class="remove-underline">patterns section</a></p>

                <p>You can right click on an unopened cell to flag them. The flag is used to indicate that there is a mine there. It also prevents you from accidentally opening the given cell.</p>
                <h3>Tips for beginners:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try to start every game from the center.</li>
                    <li>Leave guessing only as a last solution.</li>
                    <li>If a cell number is equal to the unopened cells around that cell, then all of them are mines.</li>
                    <li>If a cell number is equal to the number of flags around it, then every other adjacent cell is save.</li>
                    <li>The amount of mines left can sometimes help determining which of the last few cells are mines.</li>
                    <li>You can play better if you know more patterns.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1-1-X Pattern</h3>
                <p>Because of the leftmost 1, there is a mine guaranteed to be on either the first or second cell. In either case, the second 1 is satisfied, which means there can't be a mine on the third unopened cell.

                <h3>1-2-X Pattern</h3>
                <p>The leftmost 1 guarantees that there is a single mine in the two cells above it. Whichever it is in, it will satisfy one mine for the 2, therefore the 2's other mine must be at the thrid position.</p>
