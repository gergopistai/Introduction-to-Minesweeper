                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>This is a simple, static website made for a small university project, it will explain the basics of minesweeper and show some patterns.</p>
                <p>In my opinion one of the best places to play minesweeper is at <a href="https://minesweeper.online/">minesweeper.online</a>.</p>

                <h2>Basics of Minesweeper</h2>
                <h3>How the game works</h3>
                <p>A game of minesweeper is played on a grid of cells. Every cell can be opened, but the point of the game is to find (and flag) all the cells that are mines. If you click on a mine you lose the game. The game can be only be won if every non-mine cell is opened. You can open cells by left clicking on them.</p>
                <p>Most opened cells will have a number on them. This number represents how many mines are adjacent to that given cell (adjacency here includes diagonal cells as well). This also means that open cells with no numbers have no mines around them.</p>

                <p>There are usually two game modes: <i>Normal</i> and <i>No Guess</i> (NG for short).</p>
                <p>Normal mode is entirely randomly generated, so there are usually some guessing whether a certain cell is a mine or not. Situations where you can not tell which one of two given cells is a mine are also called 50-50.</p>
                <p>NG games are randomly generated as well, but in a way that they can be won without guessing, only by recognizing patterns.</p>

                <p>You can right click on an unopened cell to flag them. The flag is used to indicate that there is a mine there. It also prevents you from accidentally opening the given cell.</p>
                <h3>Tips for beginners:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Try to start every game from the center.</li>
                    <li>Leave guessing only as a last solution.</li>
                    <li>If a cell number is equal to the unopened cells around that cell, then all of them are mines.</li>
                    <li>If a cell number is equal to the number of flags around it, then every other adjacent cell is safe.</li>
                    <li>The amount of mines left can sometimes help determine which of the last few cells are mines.</li>
                    <li>You can improve by learning patterns.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1-1-X Pattern</h3>
                <p>Because of the <b>leftmost 1</b>, there is a mine guaranteed to be on either the <b>first or second cell</b>. In either case, the <b>second 1</b> is satisfied, which means there can't be a mine on the <b>third unopened cell</b>.

                <h3>1-2-1 Pattern</h3>
                <p>The <b>leftmost 1</b> guarantees that there is a single mine in one of the two cells above it. It doesn't matter which one is the mine, since it will satisfy one mine for <b>the 2</b>, therefore the 2's other mine must be at the <b>thrid position</b>. Then the <b>second 1</b> will be satisfied. Which means that the second cell is empty (since there can't be another mine adjacent to the <b>second 1</b>), therefore the first cell is also a mine.</p>
